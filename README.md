# phraugr

A set of simple Ruby scripts for pre-processing large files, based on [phraug2](https://github.com/zygmuntz/phraug2) (pron. frog), a similar collection written in Python.

The name _phraug_ comes from the book _Made to Stick_, by Chip and Dan Heath. Phraugr is pronounced _Frogger_, which is also an arcade game where you attempt to cross traffic.
